                  In the 21st century, skills are a major differentiator for
                  employ-ability and success in life. A study found that 80% of
                  achievements in career are determined by soft skills and 20%
                  by hard skills. So SSG’s timely initiative is Skill
                  Development Program (SDP) to develop the Z-Generation to get
                  competitive advantage in their work place. SSG ensures
                  knowledge, skills and attitude through Competency Based
                  Training (CBT).{" "}
